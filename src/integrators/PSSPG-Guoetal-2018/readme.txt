This is a re-implementation of the paper "Primary Sample Space Path Guiding".
It is implemented as an integrator and a templated acc struture.
Usage should be relatively clear for developers familiar with PBRT.
Few minor changes to PBRT are also made, but it should not be an obstacle.
This is not the exact version used in the paper, but will give a rough overview of the method.
